# neuralnet

A neural network implemented in D using Back Propagation and Momentum.

## Building

To build you'll need a recent copy of dmd and dub. It doesn't require anything
fancy. You don't even have to use my dub files.

## Use

Currently a lot is still hard-coded. The driver gives a fairly clear example of
how to use it. I'll eventually implement more functions to make it more
run-time dynamic.

## Story

I had to make a neural net as a school project. My AI partner and I each coded
our own in tandem. The turn-in project was his, with my input file parsing. But
he had did most of the work well before turn-in and I felt I was obligated to
catch up just in case he needed help.

What you are seeing is the result of that catch-up effort. I was learning D and
it sounded like a wonderful way to sharpen my skills with it. I will continue
to develop it and eventually intend to implement it in a game.
